a ghost theme for personal use on neuromancer.ca

features:

- static about and projects pages
- "last updated" date on static pages (it's actually using the date posted for now so you have to update it manually)
- icon font by [Foundation](http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icons) for social media buttons
- rss feed
- cc-by-sa badge
- responsive-width design
- optional header/logo image
- accessibility-friendly colouring, fonts, and links
- very visible tags w/ tag archive pages

updates to come based on ghost feature updates:

- real automatic "last updated" date based on modification of static pages
- a built-in commenting engine or something more anonymous than disqus at least
- better excerpt control
- which leads to "read more" style rss instead of full text as an option
